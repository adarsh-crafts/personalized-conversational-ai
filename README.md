# Building a Personalized Conversational AI to Mimic a Unique Chat Style
This repository documents the end-to-end process of building a personalized GPT-like chatbot, trained from scratch on custom chat data using PyTorch.

The primary goal is to learn and implement the full pipeline of creating a language model. This includes 
* data extraction and cleaning
* building a BPE tokenizer
* building and training a decoder-only transformer
* and using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) to teach the model a specific communication style.
